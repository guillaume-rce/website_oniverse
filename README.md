This project aims to create a website for Oniverse, a futuristic game development company. The website is an e-commerce platform that allows users to browse and purchase oniverse games. The website also includes a social part where users can interact with each other and share their experiences with the games, there is also a achievements system that rewards users for their activity on games.
